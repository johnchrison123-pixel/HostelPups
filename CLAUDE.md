# HostelPups — Claude Project Context

## ⚠️ WORKING RULES FROM OWNER (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

These rules override default Claude behavior. Read before every task.

1. **Log every instruction.** Every instruction the owner gives must be appended to the "Instructions History" section below, with date and verbatim text. Do this BEFORE executing the instruction.
2. **Estimate time first.** Before producing the full output of any prompt, give an approximate time estimate at the very top of the response (e.g., "~5 minutes"). Use these rough buckets:
   - **< 2 min** — single small file edit, quick fix, configuration tweak
   - **5–10 min** — feature work touching 3–5 files
   - **15–30 min** — multi-file feature with new components
   - **30+ min** — major build, migration, or multi-page work
3. **SEO is the prime directive.** Every page, every component, every URL must be SEO-friendly. This includes: semantic HTML, server-rendering by default, proper meta tags via `buildMetadata()`, JSON-LD structured data, fast Core Web Vitals, descriptive URLs, alt text on images, breadcrumb schema where applicable. See "SEO Standards" section for the full checklist.
4. **Never repeat a mistake from the Mistakes Log.** Before writing code, scan the "Mistakes Log — Do Not Repeat" section. If your planned approach matches a logged mistake, change course.

## 📋 Instructions History (running log)

| Date | Instruction (verbatim) |
|---|---|
| 2026-05-21 | "every instruction i give you you have to add it in claude.md file" |
| 2026-05-21 | "each prompt i give you and before giving the full output first you have to give me approximate time" |
| 2026-05-21 | "the whole project should SEO friendly" |
| 2026-05-21 | "do not make any repetitive mistakes which you already make" |
| 2026-05-21 | "give me clarification on Google Search Console + GA4 setup, and on npm run dev visual design feedback step" |
| 2026-05-21 | "CANT YOU MAKE IT IN VERCEL AND GITHUB ADD?" — push project to GitHub + deploy to Vercel for live preview |
| 2026-05-21 | GitHub repo URL provided: https://github.com/johnchrison123-pixel/HostelPups — push code + link Vercel for auto-deploys |
| 2026-05-21 | /loop — Research competitors (FindMyHostel, FineMeHostel, etc.) globally. Get inspired. Redesign landing + login. Run parallel agents. Second parallel agent: deep research + HTML report viewable on phone. Stop when done, wait for next command. |
| 2026-05-21 | "Add dummy profile cards + profiles of hostels/PGs/flats in each section (removable later). Confirm business owner + user registration features. Double-check with multiple agents that all functions are working." |
| 2026-05-21 | "There should be option to register for business in sign up section and in login section as login as business" — add prominent Renter/Business mode toggle on /signup, /login, /owner/signup, /owner/login |
| 2026-05-21 | "what all things has to be done by my side give me" — produce a complete prioritized founder action checklist |
| 2026-05-21 | (7 asks): (1) filter in left vacant section, (2) keep saved login data, (3) photos/profile/message/call data, (4) in-app call option, (5) block business from revealing phone numbers via obfuscation tricks (99five34, 9-99-78, etc), (6) find what's missing/not working, (7) for business: cover page, images, descriptions, vacancies, manage profiles |
| 2026-05-21 | "give me the codes here" — paste all 5 Supabase SQL files inline in chat for direct copy/paste (instead of GitHub navigation) |
| 2026-05-21 | (screenshots) — verification query confirms tables exist but all counts=0. Seed file didn't run. Paste seed inline. |
| 2026-05-21 | "done" — seed applied. Start Phase 1B: wire pages to Supabase queries + email magic-link auth + owner CRUD + photo upload to storage. |
| 2026-05-21 | 3 Photos/profile/message/call data storage + Keep saved login data + 4 In-app call option — start Phase 2 (chat module + WebRTC calling skeleton in parallel) |
| 2026-05-21 | /loop — find what works / what doesn't, fix everything fixable, double-check, audit all pages/profiles/options/features/functions, mark pending what needs user, fix what I can myself |
| 2026-05-21 | Reported live bug: magic link came from Supabase domain, click goes to localhost:3000. Both are Supabase dashboard config (not code). |
| 2026-05-21 | (screenshot) "email rate limit exceeded" — Supabase free tier 4 emails/hour limit hit. Two fixes: wait 1 hour OR wire custom SMTP via Resend (free 3K emails/month). |
| 2026-05-25 | (screenshot) "Error sending magic link email" — generic SMTP failure. Need to diagnose: Resend misconfigured? Sender domain rejected? Bad API key? |
| 2026-05-25 | "i forgot to add the api key as password" — root cause of magic-link error. Just paste API key into SMTP Password field. |
| 2026-05-25 | "still not working" — API key added but magic link still fails. Need Resend dashboard logs + SMTP screenshot to pinpoint. |
| 2026-05-25 | (screenshots) Supabase SMTP config looks correct on visible fields. Resend dashboard shows "No sent emails yet" — emails never reached Resend at all. Likely: Enable Custom SMTP toggle is OFF, or password didn't save. |
| 2026-05-25 | (screenshot) Toggle confirmed ON, all fields correct, Save Changes visible. Re-added API key. Still no emails in Resend. Need Auth Logs to diagnose. |
| 2026-05-25 | "Remove Resend option from beginning. Switch to login with phone number. Test dummy number and OTP like we used for RingIn app." — pivot from email magic-link to phone OTP using Supabase test phone numbers (bypasses SMS provider for testing). |
| 2026-05-25 | Rewrite LoginForm / SignupForm / OwnerSignupForm / AuthSidePanel to use Supabase phone OTP (signInWithOtp + verifyOtp). +91 prefix, 6-digit OTP, two-step (login) / three-step (signup) flows. Keep /auth/callback for future Google OAuth. |
| 2026-05-25 | "Switch to password auth. Signup form: name + email + phone + password + city + T&C tick. No phone verification for now — just create account + log in + redirect to home. Login: email OR phone + password. Same for business/owner." |
| 2026-05-25 | "is there any way to give you access to our supabase, vercel and resend so you can do everything yourself?" — yes, partial autonomy possible via API tokens. Document trade-offs + how. |
| 2026-05-25 | "will john@test.com work?" (login error screenshot) — no, Supabase rejects fake/test domains. Use a real email or Gmail alias. |
| 2026-05-25 | "find all bugs problems, features and functions that are not working. find all the issues across the app" — comprehensive audit + fix pass v2 (since password auth pivot) |
| 2026-05-25 | (screenshot — still trying john@test.com on /login) — repeat: use real Gmail address, not test.com. The "Looks good" hint only checks syntax, not whether domain is valid. |
| 2026-05-25 | "please we don't need an email to verify or confirm we just wanted to login to test our feature. so not giving public access now" — show how to create test users directly via Supabase Dashboard (bypasses signup validation). |
| 2026-05-25 | "no I wanted it in login page i don't want to do it in supabase. adjust the code for me. later we will make changes. easy login now without restrictions" — switch signup to use auth.admin.createUser server action (bypasses email validation, auto-confirms). |
| 2026-05-25 | "there should be options like calls messages saved" — add Messages/Calls/Saved/Profile links to Header user dropdown (currently only Dashboard + Logout). |
| 2026-05-25 | "where can i find the calls messages saved options?" — clarify: visible only when logged in. Top-right dropdown (desktop) or bottom nav (mobile). |
| 2026-05-25 | (screenshot) dropdown still shows only "Search PGs + Logout" — browser cached old JS bundle. Hard refresh needed. |
| 2026-05-25 | "i can't see it" — diagnose Vercel deploy status directly via CLI. |
| 2026-05-25 | (screenshot) Vercel "Production Checklist 1/5" — unrelated to dropdown bug. Checklist is optional production-readiness items (custom domain, analytics, etc). |
| 2026-05-25 | "i want a permanent solution not a temporary one" — reduce ISR revalidate from 600s to 60s + add must-revalidate Cache-Control header so deploys propagate within 1 minute (no more cache-staleness). |
| 2026-05-25 | "i want our normal url and permanent fix. add options or features like calls, messages and saved in our website" — make Saved/Messages/Calls always-visible top nav icons (not just in dropdown). |
| 2026-06-16 | "fix all these [27 bugs + 10 numbered tasks] use sonnet 4.6 for normal, opus 4.7 for heavy, opus 4.8 for review. give migration code at end." — 4 parallel agents fix pass + Opus reviewer + migration files 0005/0006/0007/0008. |
| 2026-06-16 | "for admin login what are the options we have. can we login on the same page login page and and have the options of admin panel and crm there. or do we have to create another website for admin panel." — explained 3 options (same login + role redirect / separate `/admin/login` / separate subdomain), recommended Option A. |
| 2026-06-16 | "option a. i want full admin control options and user crm and host crm option where i can edit, add, remove, ban data. supervise payments, refunds, etc" — building full `/admin` panel with user CRM, host CRM, listings/inquiries/calls/payments/reports/audit pages + migration 0009 (admin_actions audit log, is_admin() helper, ban columns, reports table, admin RLS policies). |

*New rule: append every future instruction to this table.*

## 🚫 Mistakes Log — Do Not Repeat

Real bugs I've already hit on this project. Don't make them again.

| # | Mistake | What happens | Fix / Don't do this |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Imported brand icons (`Instagram`, `Facebook`, `Twitter`, `Youtube`, `Linkedin`) from `lucide-react` | Build fails — these exports were removed for trademark reasons | Use inline SVGs for social brand icons. See `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx` for the pattern. |
| 2 | Exported a const (`FAQ_ITEMS`) from a `"use client"` file and imported it into a server component | Runtime error at prerender: "X.map is not a function" — the const becomes a client reference, not the array | Keep data in plain `.ts` files (e.g., `src/lib/faq.ts`). Client components import from there. Server components also import from there. |
| 3 | Used `l.area` when type was `LodgingSchemaInput { address: { area?: string; ... } }` | TypeScript build fails — property doesn't exist at root | Match nested type structure exactly. Always check the type definition before accessing properties. |
| 4 | Used bash `cd "..." && cmd` with unescaped quotes inside double-quoted PowerShell args | "unexpected EOF while looking for matching quote" | Use PowerShell tool with `Set-Location` + `;` chain. Don't try to fake bash on Windows. |
| 5 | Tried to read a file that wasn't written yet (READMEme from create-next-app) | "File has not been read yet" — Write tool blocks overwrites of unread files | Always `Read` a file before `Write`-ing over it, even if you "know" what's in it. |
| 6 | Used `₹` rupee glyph in `.md` files written via Write tool with potential encoding issues | (Risk only) UTF-8 BOM mismatch could mangle special chars in Windows PowerShell | Prefer `Rs` over `₹` in `README.md` when uncertain. CLAUDE.md is fine to use the glyph. |

*New rule: when you hit a real, reproducible mistake, add a row here with the fix.*

## 🔍 SEO Standards (THE prime directive)

Every page must meet this checklist before being considered done.

### Server-side
- [ ] **Page is a server component** by default. Only use `"use client"` for interactive widgets, never whole pages.
- [ ] **`buildMetadata()`** called with title, description, path, keywords. Never hand-write `<title>` or `<meta name="description">`.
- [ ] **Canonical URL** set via `alternates.canonical` (handled by `buildMetadata`).
- [ ] **Open Graph + Twitter cards** populated (handled by `buildMetadata`).
- [ ] **JSON-LD structured data** appropriate to page:
  - All pages: rely on root `Organization` + `WebSite` schema (in `app/layout.tsx`)
  - Listing pages: `LodgingBusiness` + `BreadcrumbList`
  - FAQ-bearing pages: `FAQPage`
  - City pages: `BreadcrumbList`
- [ ] Page route added to `src/app/sitemap.ts` if new.

### Markup
- [ ] **Exactly one `<h1>`** per page — the main keyword-rich headline.
- [ ] **Heading hierarchy preserved** (`h1` → `h2` → `h3`, no skipping).
- [ ] **All images use `next/image`** with `alt` text describing the actual content.
- [ ] **Semantic HTML** — `<section>`, `<article>`, `<nav>`, `<aside>`, `<main>` where appropriate.
- [ ] **`lang="en"`** on `<html>` (set in root layout).

### URL design
- [ ] URL contains target keyword (e.g., `/pg-in-kochi`, not `/listings/123`).
- [ ] Hyphens, not underscores, in slugs.
- [ ] Lowercase only.
- [ ] No trailing slash (set in `next.config.ts`).
- [ ] No query strings for canonical landing pages — use path segments.

### Performance
- [ ] Lighthouse Performance ≥ 90 on mobile.
- [ ] LCP < 2.5s, CLS < 0.1, INP < 200ms.
- [ ] Next.js `<Image>` for everything (AVIF/WebP, lazy load default, responsive sizes).
- [ ] Font: `display: swap` on Plus Jakarta Sans (already configured).
- [ ] No client-side data fetching for above-the-fold content — use server components / `generateStaticParams`.

### Content
- [ ] Each page has min 300 unique words of original copy (city + wedge pages already hit this).
- [ ] Target keyword appears in: H1, first 100 words, meta description, URL, image alt (≥ 1).
- [ ] Internal links to ≥ 3 related pages (cities link to wedge pages, wedge pages link to city pages, etc.).
- [ ] External authoritative link where natural (e.g., Wikipedia for cities, govt sites for KYC).

### Discoverability
- [ ] Page reachable from homepage in ≤ 3 clicks.
- [ ] Page appears in `sitemap.xml`.
- [ ] Page not blocked in `robots.ts` unless it's user-private (login, dashboards).

## Project Info
- **App Name:** HostelPups
- **Tagline:** India's most trusted PG, hostel & flat marketplace
- **Live URL:** TBD (planned: https://hostelpups.in and https://hostelpups.com)
- **Local Path:** C:\Users\johnc\Desktop\HostelPups\hostelpups
- **Stack:** Next.js 16 (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS 4 + Supabase + Vercel
- **Founded:** Kochi, Kerala — expanding pan-India

## Business Model (REQUIRED CONTEXT — read before touching pricing/features)

### Two-tier owner onboarding
1. **Full-service** (Kochi, Bangalore, Chennai)
   - ₹1,999 first year, ₹999/year renewal
   - HostelPups team does in-person KYC + professional photoshoot
   - Photo IP belongs to platform (anti-disintermediation)
   - Unlimited listings
2. **Self-serve** (everywhere else, including rest of Kerala)
   - ₹999/year recurring
   - Owner uploads own photos (must follow quality rules)
   - Max 3 active listings
   - Verification badge optional: ₹799/year (video call + live location + Google research)

### User pricing (one-time, NOT subscription — PG hunting is one-shot use)
- ₹99 / week — unlimited owner contact unlocks
- ₹199 / month
- ₹499 / year
- ₹29 single-contact unlock (impulse buy)

### Boost (separate add-on)
- ₹99/day, ₹499/week, ₹1,499/month — top of search

### Year 1 financial plan (Kochi + Bangalore + Chennai + Kerala self-serve + pan-India self-serve)
- Starting capital: ₹10 lakh from sleeping partner (20% equity)
- Year 1 revenue projection: ₹78.65 lakh
- Year 1 cost: ₹58.32 lakh
- Year 1 net: ~₹19-22 lakh (fully reinvested)
- Lowest cash point: ₹8.25 lakh (Month 2)
- Cash at year-end: ~₹30 lakh
- Team: 2 sales reps Kochi + 3 telecallers (1 existing + 2 new) + 1 photographer + 1 marketing manager + verification specialist (M3) + Bangalore rep (M7) + Chennai rep (M10)

### Critical strategic moves
- **3 telecallers cold-call hostels across India** to drive self-serve registrations
- **Bangalore launches M7, Chennai M10** — 1 sales rep + freelance photographer each
- **Wedge positioning**: couple-friendly, bachelor-friendly, pet-friendly, student-friendly — Front-and-center, not buried filters
- **No payment integration in V1** — defer to V2 to skip Razorpay friction. Users pay deposit to owner directly (Indian PG culture is visit-first, cash/UPI)

## Tech Stack Decisions
- **Next.js 16 App Router** — SSR for SEO (critical — Google traffic is #1 acquisition)
- **TypeScript** — type safety, better autocompletion
- **Tailwind CSS 4** — CSS-first config in globals.css, no tailwind.config.ts
- **Supabase** — auth, DB, storage, realtime (shared client in `src/lib/supabase.ts`)
- **Plus Jakarta Sans** — display + body font (modern, friendly, India-appropriate)
- **Vercel** — deployment target, auto-deploys from main
- **lucide-react** — icons (tree-shakeable)
- **clsx + tailwind-merge** — `cn()` utility for class merging
- **Capacitor** — to be added in Phase 2/3 for Android wrapper (push notifications, app store presence)

## Coding Rules (HostelPups, NOT RingIn)
- **Standard JSX** — not React.createElement (different from RingIn). Next.js ecosystem assumes JSX.
- **TypeScript everywhere** — `.tsx` for components, `.ts` for utilities
- **Server components by default** — only use `"use client"` when needed (interactivity, hooks)
- **No `any` types** — use proper types from `src/lib/types.ts`
- **All metadata via `buildMetadata()`** — never hand-write `<head>` tags
- **All prices via `PRICING` constant** in `src/lib/site.ts` — single source of truth
- **All city names via `CITY_NAMES`** — no hand-typed display names
- **`cn()` for conditional classes** — never string concatenation
- **Tailwind 4 syntax** — `bg-[var(--color-brand-500)]` for CSS variable colors

## Design System
- **Primary yellow:** `--color-brand-500` (#F0B429)
- **Off-white background:** `--color-bg` (#FFFCF5)
- **Pink CTA accent:** `--color-cta` (#E91E63) — for "Pay", "Contact", "Sign Up Now"
- **Success green:** `--color-success` (#10B981) — verified badges
- **Wedge color tokens** for couple (pink), bachelor (indigo), pet (teal), student (amber)
- **Border radius scale:** `--radius-sm`, `--radius`, `--radius-lg`, `--radius-xl`, `--radius-full`
- **Shadows:** subtle, brand-tinted (warm yellow undertone)

## SEO Strategy
- **Static generation** for all city + wedge + marketing pages — instant Google indexing
- **Server-rendered** listing detail pages — populated in Phase 1 from Supabase
- **JSON-LD schemas** baked in: `Organization`, `WebSite`, `LodgingBusiness`, `BreadcrumbList`, `FAQPage`
- **URL structure for keyword ranking:**
  - `/pg-in-kochi` — city landings (concatenated for SEO)
  - `/pg/kochi/listing-slug` — individual listings
  - `/couple-friendly-pg/kochi` — wedge pages (specifically rank for these queries)
  - `/bachelor-friendly-pg/kochi`, `/pet-friendly-pg/kochi`
- **Sitemap auto-generates** all city + wedge + static URLs
- **Open Graph + Twitter cards** on every page via `buildMetadata()`

## Phase Roadmap
- **Phase 0 (DONE — current state):** Foundation, landing page, marketing pages, SEO infrastructure, routing skeleton, placeholder auth/listing pages
- **Phase 1 (NEXT):** Supabase schema, real auth (phone OTP), owner listing CRUD, real search + filters, listing detail with photos
- **Phase 2:** Razorpay payments, in-app chat with auto-redaction, owner dashboard with stats + boost, KYC verification flow
- **Phase 3:** Admin panel, automated email/SMS notifications, renewal reminders, refund handling, mobile app via Capacitor

## Database Migrations — Expand-Contract Pattern (CRITICAL)
Same rules as RingIn:
- Every schema change MUST be backward-compatible OR forward-compatible, NEVER both at once
- Use Supabase CLI migrations in `supabase/migrations/NNNN_name.sql`
- Client code should assume column "may not exist yet" (use try/catch with `.from(...).select(...)`)
- Never rename a column in-place — add new, backfill, switch reads, drop old

## Anti-Disintermediation Rules (CRITICAL)
Every chat message must pass through `redactContactInfo()` in `src/lib/utils.ts`. Blocks:
- Indian mobile numbers (10 digits, +91/0 prefix optional)
- Email addresses
- UPI IDs (@paytm, @okhdfcbank, etc.)
- WhatsApp/Telegram links
- Common phrases ("call me at...", "WhatsApp me", "DM me")

Strike system in chat:
- 2 violations → soft warning toast
- 3 violations → owner suspended for 7 days
- 5 violations → permanent ban without refund

## Pricing — Single Source of Truth
All prices live in `PRICING` constant in `src/lib/site.ts`. Never hardcode rupee amounts in components — import from there.

## Deployment

### Live URLs
- **Production:** https://hostelpups.vercel.app
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/johnchrison123-pixel/HostelPups
- **Vercel dashboard:** https://vercel.com/johnchrison123-pixels-projects/hostelpups
- **Vercel scope:** `johnchrison123-pixels-projects`
- **Branch:** `main` (auto-deploys to production)

### Workflow — how to deploy a change
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\johnc\Desktop\HostelPups\hostelpups"
# 1. Make code changes
# 2. Test locally if needed: npm run dev
# 3. Verify build: npm run build
git add .
git commit -m "feat: <short description of what changed>"
git push origin main
# 4. Vercel auto-deploys in ~1-2 minutes. Watch progress at the dashboard URL above.
```

### Commit message style
Follow conventional commits (consistent with RingIn):
- `feat: ` — new feature or page
- `fix: ` — bug fix
- `refactor: ` — code refactor with no behavior change
- `style: ` — visual/CSS only
- `docs: ` — documentation
- `chore: ` — config, deps, tooling
- `seo: ` — SEO-specific change (meta, schema, sitemap, etc.)

### Pre-launch checklist
- [ ] Buy both domains: `hostelpups.in` (primary) + `hostelpups.com` (redirect)
- [ ] Add custom domains in Vercel dashboard → Settings → Domains
- [ ] Set up Google Search Console (DNS TXT verification for both domains)
- [ ] Set up Google Analytics 4 + add `G-XXXXXXXXXX` to `.env.local` as `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID`
- [ ] Submit sitemap.xml to Google Search Console
- [ ] Set up Supabase project + add keys to Vercel env vars (Project Settings → Environment Variables)
- [ ] Set up Razorpay account + add keys to Vercel env vars
- [ ] Set up MSG91 + add keys

### Environment variables — where they live
- **Local development:** `.env.local` (gitignored, never committed)
- **Production:** Vercel dashboard → Project → Settings → Environment Variables
- Variables prefixed `NEXT_PUBLIC_` are exposed to the browser. Everything else is server-only.

## Key Decisions to Confirm Before Phase 1
1. ✅ **Stack:** Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind 4 + Supabase
2. ✅ **Project location:** `~/Desktop/HostelPups/hostelpups/`
3. ✅ **Domain:** both `.in` + `.com`
4. ✅ **Coding style:** Standard JSX + TypeScript
5. ✅ **Theme:** Yellow + off-white
6. ✅ **₹1,999 first year + ₹999/year renewal** for full-service tier
7. ✅ **3 active listings limit** for self-serve (NOT 3/month)
8. ⏳ **Auto-renewal via Razorpay UPI mandate** — confirm in Phase 2
